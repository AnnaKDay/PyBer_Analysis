# PyBer_Analysis
Ride-sharing analysis with python and MatPlotLib

# Overview
This analysis was conducted to summarize rideshare data from January to early May, 2019 for the purpose of providing visualizations that the PyBer company can use to make business decisions. This particular analysis focuses on the average fares by city type.
# Results
- Rural cities have the least rides and drivers, at an average of around 1.6 rides for 1 driver. As such total fares are generally low, and ride fares are high for each ride. Drivers in rural cities make more on average from giving rides.
- Suburban cities have an average of 1.3 rides per driver. Total Fares are 5 times higher than in rural cities. The average fare per ride is 4 dollars lower than in rural cities. However, the average fare per driver is 15 dollars less. 
- Urban cities have an average of 0.67 rides per driver. This means that there are more drivers than there are rides. Due to the higher volume of rides, total Fares are 20,000 dollars higher than Suburban cities. The Average fare per ride is also 6 dollars cheaper. Drivers make an average of $16.57 between the months of January and May, which is only 30% of what drivers in Rural cities make.
# Summary
- Firstly, there are more drivers than necessary in the urban cities. My suggestion would be to place a soft cap on the number of drivers who are employed by PyBer, with enough in reserve to cover upsweeps in demand. 
- Secondly, Rural and Suburban cities have too few drivers and should endeavor to employ more drivers to even out the disparities between city types. 
- Finally, urban fare prices could be increased slightly to offset the price drop from Rural to Urban.
(I am not completely sure about the ethics of these suggestions, and would have to be more studied in economics to know if they make sense in the market for ridesharing)
